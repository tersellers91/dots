# dots


My waybar is not my own. Here is his github: https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles


I use swww for wallpaper and I have added a few module to his waybar for things like brightness and volume.

Listed files include:
1. waybar config and style.css + the scripts and assets necessary for it to work.
2. My hyprland conf
3. My hyprlock conf
4. A link to the gtk theme I use: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2278411
5. Fastfetch conf and the custom ascii art files I rotate through
6. And finally my wallpaper
